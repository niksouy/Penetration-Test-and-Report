<h1>Penetration Test and Report Project (web applications, Linux Servers, and Windows machines)


<h2>Description</h2>
For this project, I conducted a PenTest against Rekall's network infrastructure and scored all the vulnerabilities using the CVSS scoring system. I targeted their Apache web server, as well as their Windows and Linux servers. I categorized these vulnerabilities by considering both Exploitation Likelihood and Potential Impact. The purpose of this engagement was to assess the networks’ and systems’ security and identify potential security flaws by utilizing industry-accepted
testing methodology and best practices  


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>MITRE ATT&CK: choosing proper techniques to conduct the exploit</b> 
- <b>OSINT Framework and Google: for Passive Reconnaissance</b>
- <b>Shodan.io and Recon-ng: for Active Reconnaissance</b>
- <b>Nmap and Zenmap: for scanning opened ports and services on targeted CIDR</b>
- <b>SearchSploit and Exploit-DB: for choosing the exploit</b>
- <b>Metasploit C2 Framework: for Active Reconnaissance</b>
  
<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Kali Linux and internet</b> 

<h2>Assessment Objective</h2>
The primary goal of this assessment was to analyze the security flaws present in Rekall’s
web applications, networks, and systems. This assessment was conducted to identify exploitable
vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities to
provide a greater level of security for the environment.
I used the proven vulnerability testing methodology to assess all relevant web applications,
networks, and systems in scope.
